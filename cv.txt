Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to play pranks on his family. One day, he decided to hide his mother's phone in the fridge to see her reaction when she couldn't find it.
Later that day, Timmy's mother went to the fridge to get some snacks and noticed her phone was missing. She searched the entire house, turning it upside down, and even called her own phone number from the landline, hoping it would ring and give away its location. But there was no luck.
Meanwhile, Timmy watched from a distance, trying hard not to burst into laughter. Finally, after an hour of searching, Timmy's mother gave up and sat down on the couch in frustration.
Just then, Timmy walked over to her with a mischievous grin on his face and handed her the missing phone. "Gotcha, Mom!" he exclaimed.
His mother couldn't help but laugh at the silly prank and gave him a playful pat on the back. From that day on, Timmy learned that a good joke is always worth the laughter it brings, but it's also important to put things back where they belong.
